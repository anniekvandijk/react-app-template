# React template

This is a React template for own use.

- React  
- Webpack  
- Babel
- Express
- Material UI (because I thik this looks very cool!)
- Eslint

Dev mode has two 'hot' servers
- Express with nodemon for backend
- Webpack-dev-server for frontend

Production only uses Express

Webpack with production optimalisation
